Then loading the geographic crosswalk table for AZ, I got an encoding error.
I was able to fix it by explicitly declaring the encoding for the incoming
CSV as latin-1.

When I was loading origin destination data for CA, it failed when loading 2005:
EOFError: Compressed file ended before the end-of-stream marker was reached
